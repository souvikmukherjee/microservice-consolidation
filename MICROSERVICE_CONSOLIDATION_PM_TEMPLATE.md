```mermaid
gitgraph
    commit id: "Initial"
    branch develop
    commit id: "Dev Setup"
    
    branch feature/team-a-user-service
    commit id: "User API"
    commit id: "User Tests"
    
    branch feature/team-b-order-service
    commit id: "Order Logic"
    commit id: "Order Tests"
    
    checkout develop
    merge feature/team-a-user-service
    
    branch release/sprint-1
    commit id: "Release Prep"
    
    checkout main
    merge release/sprint-1
    tag: "v1.0.0"
    
    checkout develop
    merge feature/team-b-order-service
```

# 🔧 Step 2: Daily sync (run each morning)
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/develop

# ⚠️ Handle conflicts immediately
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "🚨 CONFLICT DETECTED - Resolve immediately!"
    echo "📞 Contact Tech Lead if needed"
    exit 1
