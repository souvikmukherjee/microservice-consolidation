However, this alone does not indicate a conflict.\n\n2. **Path**:\n   - Endpoint 1 uses a single path parameter `{userName}` directly under the root. It is designed to retrieve user information based on a username.\n   - Endpoint 2 has a more complex path structure `/path-variables/{p1}/{p2}`. It involves two path parameters, which typically implies it's used for a different purpose, likely to access resources based on two distinct identifiers.\n\n3. **Context**:\n   - The context of Endpoint 1 is related to user management within a microservices architecture (likely retrieving user details based on a username).\n   - The context of Endpoint 2 involves a service implemented using the Dubbo framework and seems to be handling multiple path variables, which suggests a different functional area, likely unrelated to user management.\n\nGiven these differences in path structure and likely use cases, there is no functional overlap or conflict between these endpoints."
